# üöÄ Smart Contract Generator

Smart Contract Generator is an AI-powered tool that simplifies the creation of smart contracts for the Rootstock network. 
Users describe contract logic in plain English, and the AI generates deployable Solidity code.

## Features
- üß† Natural language to Solidity conversion
- üîê Security-focused code generation
- ‚ö° Instant contract scaffolding for Rootstock
- üìÑ Auto-commented, readable smart contract output

## Example Use Case
The prompt was used to streamline smart contract development, allowing non-technical users to describe the contract logic in plain English while GPT-4 generated deployable Solidity code. This drastically reduces entry barriers for Rootstock development and speeds up prototyping.


# üìù Smart Contract Generator

## Prompt Title: Generate a Custom Smart Contract from Natural Language

## Prompt Text:
"Convert the following user requirements into a secure and optimized Solidity smart contract for deployment on the Rootstock network. The contract must follow best practices for security and efficiency, and include clear inline comments.

User Requirements:

Token Name: GreenCoin

Symbol: GRN

Fixed Supply: 10,000,000 tokens

Standard: ERC-20 compatible."

## Expected Output:
A Solidity smart contract for the Rootstock network that creates an ERC-20 token named GreenCoin (GRN) with a fixed supply of 10 million tokens, written with security best practices and properly commented.

## AI Model / Tool Used:
GPT-4

## Use Case:
The prompt was used to streamline smart contract development, allowing non-technical users to describe the contract logic in plain English while GPT-4 generated deployable Solidity code. This drastically reduces entry barriers for Rootstock development and speeds up prototyping.

## Best Practices / Insights:

The more precise the natural language description, the more accurate and secure the generated smart contract.

Including Rootstock network and best practices in the prompt improved compatibility and reduced code refactoring.

Follow-up prompts like: "Review the contract for security issues and suggest improvements." provided another layer of automated validation.

## Example Output:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract GreenCoin is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("GreenCoin", "GRN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 10000000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```
